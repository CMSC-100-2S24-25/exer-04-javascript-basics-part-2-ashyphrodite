## Description

This exercise tackles the use node packagesâ€”from installation to calling the specific functions. The exercise itself is about implementing a simple user logging system with basic validation. It also included writing to files in node.

## Instructions
After cloning the repo, what we need to run is the `test.js` file and not `index.js`. In your terminal, type:
```bash
node test.js
```

## Challenges Encountered

The challenges I encountered while doing this exercise in general are really just finding the right functions for an specific task because I don't memorize everything.

## Key Takeaways

Node package manager is incredibly useful for using functions that are already implemented before by other programmers. This speeds up development because you only have to read the documentation for the usage. Personally, although I knew and have used this in the past, this served as a refresher.
